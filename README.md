# Overview
#### My Recipe Book is a Java-based Android app developed in Android Studio, with Firebase Database integration for seamless data management. The app serves as a centralized hub for users to store, categorize, and share their favorite recipes.

# Languages, Tools, and Architecture
#### Java
#### Android Studio
#### FireBase Database


#### In My Recipe Book, Java handles core functionalities like UI interactions, data processing, and business logic.
### Components in MVC Style

#### While My Recipe Book doesn't strictly adhere to the MVC architecture, the project is organized into distinct components that align with MVC principles:

 #### Models: Handle data operations and business logic. In our app, Models interact with Firebase to manage recipe data.

 #### Fragments: Represent the UI components and manage their lifecycle. Fragments in My Recipe Book correspond to different screens or views within the app, such as recipe lists, details, and user profiles.

 #### Adapters: Bridge the gap between Models and Fragments/Activities. Adapters in our app are used to populate data from Models into RecyclerViews or ListViews displayed in Fragments.

 #### Activities: Serve as the entry points and main controllers of the app. Activities in My Recipe Book manage the navigation between Fragments and handle user interactions.

 # Key Features

 #### Add, Organize, and Categorize: Users can easily add new recipes, organize them into categories, and manage their collection with ease.
